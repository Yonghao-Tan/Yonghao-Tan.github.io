<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I am an undergraduate student at [School of Microelectronics](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/) , [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) (ÂçóÊñπÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶Ê∑±Ê∏ØÂæÆÁîµÂ≠êÂ≠¶Èô¢) now, pursuing the bachelor's degree, advised by [Fengwei An (ÂÆâ‰∏∞‰ºü)](https://sme.sustech.edu.cn/index/teacher/neiye/id/35.html). Currently, I'm leading a research project of SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) accelerator in IntelliSense VLSI Lab. Besides, I'm partitioning in a collaborative project which focus on transformer based co-design AI accelerator with [AI Chip Center for Emerging Smart Systems (ACCESS)](https://inno-access.hk/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). If you are interested, here is my [CV](https://Yonghao-Tan.github.io/files/CV_YonghaoTan.pdf).

I won the Shenzhen Longsys Electronics Company Award (Top 2% in School of Microelectronics), the First Prize of 2021 National College Students FPGA Innovation Design Competition (Top 22 in 1341 teams), and the First Prize of 2021 International Competition of Autonomous Running Robots (Top 1 of 34 teams in final match).

My research interest includes hardware acceleration for vision algorithms, AI accelerator, SLAM, and high-performance and low-power VLSI circuit design. I have published one paper at the top international solid stage journal.
